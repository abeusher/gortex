// DetectCrossRepoEdges is the graph-wide materialisation pass for the
// cross-repo edge layer (M3). It walks every resolved calls / implements
// / extends edge and, whenever the From node and the To node live in
// two different repos, emits a parallel edge of the matching
// cross_repo_* kind and sets Edge.CrossRepo on the base edge so the
// bool flag and the dedicated kind never disagree.
//
// The pass is a full recompute and is idempotent: graph.AddEdge dedupes
// by edgeKey, so re-emitting an unchanged parallel edge is a no-op. It
// is also incremental-safe — graph.EvictFile removes a node's edges in
// both directions, so when either endpoint's file is reindexed the
// stale parallel edge is gone before this pass re-runs. Parallel
// cross_repo_* edges are themselves skipped (CrossRepoKindFor only maps
// the three base kinds), so the pass never feeds on its own output.
//
// Runs at every resolver "settle" point: the tail of
// CrossRepoResolver.ResolveAll / ResolveForRepo (cross-repo calls just
// lifted by the boundary resolver) and inside the indexers'
// RunGlobalGraphPasses (cross-repo implements / extends just produced
// by InferImplements / InferOverrides).
//
// Returns the count of cross-repo relationships found this pass — the
// number of parallel edges that exist after it, modulo graph dedup.
